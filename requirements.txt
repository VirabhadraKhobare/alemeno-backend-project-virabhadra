Flask==2.3.3
streamlit==1.35.0
openai==0.28.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
requests==2.31.0

# Notes: Adding `Flask` here makes the Streamlit Cloud environment also
# install Flask so route modules that import Flask won't raise ModuleNotFoundError.
# This increases the deployment footprint slightly but keeps the runtime
# imports working without shims. If you prefer to keep `requirements.txt`
# minimal, remove `Flask==2.3.3` and rely on the import-safe guards and shims.
